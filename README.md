## The game-play is as follows 👾

1. You have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word that is space-related. 
2. For every guess, the color of the tile is revealed telling you whether the letter is in the right spot (green), wrong sport (yellow) or not part of the word at all (gray).
3. If you want to dive into another word sometime through the game, or when you are finished, you can click the rocket icon 🚀 on the top right to launch a new game. 

#### Extras: 
- If you enjoy music while playing, click on the 🎵 icon
- If you want words of encouragement from an alien, click on the 👽 icon
